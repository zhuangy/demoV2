Code for embedding stays identical so switching between development and production states is as simple as changing the config for express.\n\n### What it does ###\nThe Express Uglify middleware intercepts JS file calls and runs them through the [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) package to compress and cache the files. If the file has been previously cached it just access that file on disk in a .cache directory and serves that file. All cached files are stored as xxxxx.ugly.js where xxxxx is the starting point. i.e. jquery-1.6.2.js -> jquery-1.6.2.ugly.js\n\n## To Do ##\n- Use [ConnectJS](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/) caching API to provide proper headers\n- Comprehensive unit tests\n\n## Usage:\n\n    var expressUglify = require('express-uglify');\n    app.use(expressUglify.middleware({ \n      src: __dirname + '/public',\n      logLevel: 'info',\n      logger: new (winston.Logger)() // Specify your own winston logger or category\n    }));\n\n### MIT LICENSE\n\n\n",
